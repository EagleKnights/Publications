robot (i.e., a mobile robot with a nonholonomic constraint whose turning radius is lower-bounded). We present a fast and exact planner for our mobile robot 
model, based upon recursive subdivision of a collision-free path generated by a 
lower-level geometric planner that ignores the motion constraints. The resultant
trajectory is optimized to give a path that is of near-minimal length in its 
homotopy class. Our claims of high speed are supported by experimental results 
for implementations that assume a robot moving amid polygonal obstacles. The 
completeness and the complexity of the algorithm are proven using an 
appropriate metric in the configuration space R/sup 2//spl times/S/sup 1/ of the
robot. This metric is defined by using the length of the shortest paths in the 
absence of obstacles as the distance between two configurations. We prove that 
the new induced topology and the classical one are the same. Although we 
concentrate upon the car-like robot, the generalization of these techniques 
leads to new theoretical issues involving sub-Riemannian geometry and to 
practical results for nonholonomic motion planning."

                 sufficiently detailed, it is used to predict the widget
                 which is most likely to be used next by the user. Upon
                 entering this widget, two magnets in a specialized
                 mouse are activated to stop the movement, so target
                 acquisition becomes easier and more comfortable.
                 Besides the intelligent control system, we will present
                 several methods to generate haptic cues which might be
                 integrated in multimodal user interfaces in the
                 future.",

to be a tool for molecular scientists. The manipulator is used to generate the 
forces and torques exerted on the drug molecule when it is aligned with the 
receptor site by the user's hand. The manipulator serves both as an input device
for 6-D manipulation and as an output device for generating forces. Preliminary 
testing indicates that the system might enhance the biochemist's understanding

                 environments. For this synergy of haptics and graphics
                 to flourish, however, haptic systems must be capable of
                 modeling environments with the same richness,
                 complexity and interactivity that can be found in
                 existing graphic systems. To help meet this challenge,
                 we have developed a haptic rendering system that allows
                 for the efficient tactile display of graphical
                 information. The system uses a common high-level
                 framework to model contact constraints, surface
                 shading, friction and texture. The multi-level control
                 system also helps ensure that the haptic device will
                 remain stable even as the limits of the renderer's
                 capabilities are reached.",

Title="A Layered Approach to Learning Client Behaviors in the
      {R}obo{C}up Soccer Server",  
Journal="Applied Artificial Intelligence",   
Year="1998",
Volume="12",
pages="165--188",
abstract={
               In the past few years, Multiagent Systems (MAS) has
               emerged as an active subfield of Artificial
               Intelligence (AI).  Because of the inherent complexity
               of MAS, there is much interest in using Machine
               Learning (ML) techniques to help build multiagent
               systems.  Robotic soccer is a particularly good domain
               for studying MAS and Multiagent Learning.  Our approach
               to using ML as a tool for building Soccer Server
               clients involves layering increasingly complex learned
               behaviors.  In this article, we describe two levels of
               learned behaviors.  First, the clients learn a
               low-level individual skill that allows them to control
               the ball effectively.  Then, using this learned skill,
               they learn a higher-level skill that involves multiple
               players.  For both skills, we describe the learning
               method in detail and report on our extensive empirical
               testing.  We also verify empirically that the learned
               skills are applicable to game situations.

  behavior-based approach to generating a multirobot controller for a 
  group of mobile robots performing a clean-up and collection task. The 
  paper studies a territorial approach to the task in which the robots 
  are assigned individual territories that can be dynamically resized if 
  one of the robots malfunctions, permitting the completion of the task. 
  The described controller is implemented on a group of four IS Robotics 
  R2e mobile robots. Using a collection of experimental robot data, we 
  empirically derive and demonstrate most effective foraging in our 
  domain, and show the decline of performance of the space division 
  strategy with increased group size.

                The path planner SANDROS (Selective and Non-uniformly

                to generate a path from the start to the goal
                through an initially coarse list of subgoals
                which partition configuration space. It uses a
                fast local planner to check the connection
                between each pair of subgoals.

with randomly generated spheres (or cylinders) of maximum radius.  Each
sphere, termed a `neighborhood', is a vertex in a Random Neighborhood
Graph (RNG).  The radius of a neighborhood should be as large as possible
and is determined using clearance information from the collision detection
routines. Overlapping neighborhoods have an edge between them.
For each query, a potential function with no local minima other than the goal
is created on the fly.
Using the results of Miller, Teng, Thurston, \& Vavasis as an underlying
technique, the authors claim their method is not dependent on dof 
but rather on the number of spheres, $n$. 
No satisfactory way of keeping $n$ low is presented.
This method does not consider the narrow passage
problem.  Implementation results are presented for up to 5 dof."
